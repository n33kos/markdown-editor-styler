# Main Title (H1)

This is a sample markdown file to test the header styling extension.

## Section Header (H2)

Here's some regular text under an H2 header.

### Subsection (H3)

More content here with different styling.

#### Sub-subsection (H4)

Even more nested content.

##### Minor Header (H5)

This is getting pretty nested now.

###### Tiny Header (H6)

The smallest header level.

## Another Section

Regular paragraph text to show contrast with the headers.

### Code Example

```javascript
// This code block should not be affected by header styling
function example() {
    console.log("Headers above should be styled differently");
}
```

### List Example

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

## Final Thoughts

The headers should now display with different font sizes based on their level, making the document structure much easier to parse visually while editing.
