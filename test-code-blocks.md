# Real Header (should be styled)

This is a normal header that should get styled.

## Another Real Header

More content here.

```javascript
# This is NOT a header - it's inside a code block
## This is also NOT a header
function test() {
    // # This comment with hash should not be styled
    console.log("Hello world");
}
```

### Back to Real Headers

This should be styled again.

```bash
# This bash comment should NOT be styled
echo "# This string with hash should not be styled either"
```

#### Final Real Header

And some `inline code with # hash` that should not affect styling.

```python
def example():
    # Python comment with hash - should NOT be styled
    pass
```

##### Last Real Header

The end.
